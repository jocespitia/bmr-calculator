## Basal Metabolic Rate Calulator

Your BMR is the amount of energy your body exerts when resting. To calculate your BMR, I used the [revised Harris-Benedict equation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4278349/#R3)

After calculation of the BMR, your activity level is then factored into this equation. The result provides you with how many calories your body needs based on your activity level.
